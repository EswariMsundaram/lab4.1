How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?
Initially I started with the empty function without parameters and then used parameters. For small changes have to write multiple codes but function with parameters reduces the code redundancy.
It was confusing at the beginning when I see the wrong output. Started working over and over with function and different parameters was helpful.

What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
I didn't face any conditional logic challenges. But did face in nested if else condition, Multiple statement were listed in the output as it is not supposed to.
Then realised to include return in every if statement, so that it will come out that loop once the condition is satisfied instead of keep listing the remaining ifstatements.

How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?
I find refactoring improves readability and maintainability as it reduces the code. 
Instead writing the same set of codes, refactoring is done simply by additional parameters and a little bit of code.
